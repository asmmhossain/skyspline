Description: Phylodynamic inference of epidemic population size and reproduction numbers given time scaled pathogen phylogenies. This package supports standard coalescent models and multi-scale coalescent models that account for within-host evolution. Methods are provided for simulating trees. Estimation of standard errors can be accomplished by likelihood profiling or parametric bootstrap.
